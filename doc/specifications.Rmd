# User requirements

As a user, I need TissueTMDD app to be able to:
  
  - Run PK simulation using a preloaded model,
  - Let me customize the simulations by changing value for most the relevant parameters,
  - Pick the output path I want,
  - Export and import simulation settings,
  - Display simulation result as concentration over time plot,
  - Compare at least two simulations results graphically,
  - Compare at least two simulations parameters,
  - Change from log (default) to linear scale on y axis,
